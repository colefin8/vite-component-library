# Overflow Tooltip Directive

Place this directive on the element where you want to conditionally add a `title` attribute to an element. The `title` will only be applied if the element's 
contents are overflowing.

**This directive does not set any overflow styling.**
**Any styles for handling overflow of an element's contents must be applied manually.**

import { Story } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

## Basic Configuration

For the basic use case, the `title` attribute appears on the same element that is checked for overflow.

<Story id="directives-overflowtooltip--default" />

```html
<p v-overflow-tooltip="Some text that will cause overflow to occur.">
    Some text that will cause overflow to occur.
</p>
```

## Custom Target Element

You can optionally provide `targetElementId` if you want the `title` to appear on a different element than the one that is checked for overflow. 
In this case, the element with an `id` matching `targetElementId` is checked for overflow and the element on which the directive is placed receives the `title`.

<Story id="directives-overflowtooltip--custom-target" />

```html
<div v-overflow-tooltip="{ tooltipText: 'Some text that will cause overflow to occur.', targetElementId: 'overflow-target' }">
    <p id="overflow-target">
        Some text that will cause overflow to occur.
    </p>
</div>
```
