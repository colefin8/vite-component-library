# Click Outside Directive

Place this directive on the element that you want a window click listener to watch if outside of the element gets clicked.
It is most commonly useful for dropdowns or other UI elements that have togglable content.

import { Story } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

## How to Use

The directive takes a callback function that will fire whenever outside of the target element is clicked.

<Story id="directives-clickoutside--default" />

```html
<aco-button :v-click-outside="onClickOutside">
    Click me and nothing happens, click outside and an alert shows.
</aco-button>
```
